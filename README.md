# MongoDB $in Operator with Single Element Array

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with a single-element array.  The `$in` operator is intended for checking if a field's value exists within a set of values, but using it with a single-element array doesn't behave as you might expect.

The `bug.js` file shows the incorrect usage, and the `bugSolution.js` provides the correct solution.

## Problem

When you use `$in` with a single-element array, MongoDB doesn't optimize the query as a direct equality check. This can lead to performance issues, especially on large collections.  The query might not return expected results under specific conditions. 

## Solution

For a single value check, use a direct equality comparison operator (`==` or `$eq`). This ensures efficient querying and avoids potential issues caused by the `$in` operator's behavior with single-element arrays.
